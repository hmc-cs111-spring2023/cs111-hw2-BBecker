**Question**

Pick three quotes from the readings about language design. Good candidates
are:

- Something you agreed with / resonates with your own experience
- Something you disagree with
- Something that is interesting, a new idea or perspective you'd like to remember
- Something you didn't understand

For each quote, describe what it was about the quote that led you pick it.

**Response**

"In practice, the most important criterion for a new language feature is that it should make things easier for the programmers who use the language." [Steele, 1998] - This quote resonates with me as I believe that the primary purpose of a programming language is to make the programmer's life easier and their job more efficient. What would be the point of making a language more complex for the user?

"When a language designer allows too many ways to do the same thing, the language becomes unnecessarily complex, and the programs written in it become more difficult to understand." [Bloch, 2006] - This quote caught my attention because I disagree with the idea that limiting the number of ways to do something in a language is necessary. I believe that providing multiple options to achieve the same result can help increase the creativity of programmers and enable them to come up with more innovative solutions. At the same time I see Bloch’s point and acknowledge that a surplus of to many ways to do something could also be a problem.

"People aren't naturally good at code; they have to learn how to do it." [Pavlus, 2012] - This quote is an interesting perspective on language design as it highlights the fact that programming languages are not intuitive and require a significant amount of effort to learn and master. As for me I feel like programing languages are similar to modern languages such as spanish or italian in the sense that they require learning. However I also feel that for myself and possibly other math based minds programing laguages are easier to learn and build off of each other over time.

**Question**

How would you know a well-designed language? What are the symptoms? How would
you know a poorly designed language? What are the symptoms?

**Response**

A well-designed language is characterized by its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. The syntax should be intuitive and straightforward, and the language should have clear and concise documentation. A well-designed language should also allow for a high degree of flexibility and scalability, so that it can be adapted to changing requirements over time.
On the other hand, a poorly designed language is one that is overly complex, with confusing syntax, inconsistent naming conventions, and poorly documented libraries. A poorly designed language also has limited functionality and cannot be adapted to new requirements.

**Question**

How might the themes of _Growing a Language_ relate to ideas from the Fowler reading?

**Response**

The themes of _Growing a Language_ relate to ideas from the Fowler reading in the sense that both emphasize the importance of language design in software development. Both readings stress the need for programming languages to be designed in a way that makes it easy for programmers to write, understand, and maintain code. Furthermore, both readings highlight the importance of designing a language that is flexible, scalable, and adaptable to changing requirements.

**Question**

In what way is an API a language?

**Response**

An API is a language in the sense that it specifies the way in which different software components interact with each other. Like a programming language, an API defines a set of rules and syntax that must be followed in order to use it effectively. An API also defines the types of inputs and outputs that are expected, and the specific actions that can be performed using the API.

**Question**

What does the post on grayscale tell us about the process of API design?

**Response**

The post on grayscale colors highlights the importance of making the process of using an API as simple and intuitive as possible. The author suggests that the design of the API should be straightforward and easy to use, so that developers can focus on the functionality they are trying to achieve, rather than struggling with the complexity of the API itself. This post emphasizes the importance of language design in the development of APIs and the need for APIs to be well-designed in order to be useful and effective.

**Question**

The Pavlus article mentions the researchers' comments that people preferred
"natural-language replacements for some of the more abstruse syntax". In other
words, people found it easier to work with code that looks more like a human language (e.g.,
English). Consider the following quote by William R. Cook, one of the creators
of AppleScript:

> The experiment in designing a language that resembled natural languages (English
> and Japanese) was not successful. It was assumed that scripts should be
> presented in “natural language” so that average people could read and write
> them. … In the end the syntactic variations and flexibility did more to confuse
> programmers than to help them out. It is not clear whether it is easier for
> novice users to work with a scripting language that resembles natural language,
> with all its special cases and idiosyncrasies. The main problem is that
> AppleScript only appears to be a natural language: in fact, it is an artificial
> language, like any other programming language. … even small changes to the
> script may introduce subtle syntactic errors that baffle users. It is easy to
> read AppleScript, but quite hard to write it.
> [[Cook 2007, page 1-20]](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1238844.1238845)

Are these two experiences of natural languages at odds with one another? Would
you choose to include natural language in the design of a DSL? If so, how might
you do so? If not, why not?

**Response**

The two experiences of natural language are not necessarily at odds with one another, as the success of natural language in language design depends on the specific context. In some cases, a natural language approach can improve readability and comprehension, while in other cases, it may lead to confusion and complexity. The choice to include natural language in the design of a DSL would depend on the goals of the language and the target audience. If the goal is to improve readability and accessibility for non-technical users, natural language may be a useful tool. However, if the goal is to create a concise and efficient language, a more structured and artificial approach may be more appropriate.
